-------------------------------

Open the folder where you cloned the repo and create a folder structure like:

* `LASTNAME_FIRSTNAME`
	* `MATERIALNAME_MATERIALTHICKNESS`
		* `test_1`
			* `settings.txt` - the settings you used for the first 6 test colors and the results of running test pattern on your material.
			* `results.jpg` - photo of the results of your test run
		* `test_2`
